//Project description file for es29857_Assignment2.

Use per-pixel manipulation to create series of filters (Grayscale, contrast, Gaussian blue, edge detection).

Implement input-handling (key presses 0-4) and image buffering.

Create deep copies so that filters do not stack.

Use setup() function to allow loading images of multiple sizes

Use a kernel/convolution matrix when filters requiring neighborhood input are called.
